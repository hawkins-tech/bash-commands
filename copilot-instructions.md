## Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Include comments for complex operations
- Follow bash best practices and conventions
- Use shellcheck for linting bash scripts

### Documentation
- All scripts should have a header comment explaining their purpose
- Include usage examples in README.md
- Document any dependencies or prerequisites
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Testing
- Test scripts in a safe environment before committing
- Verify scripts work across common shells (bash, zsh)
- Consider edge cases and error handling

### Git Workflow
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Update README.md when adding new commands or scripts

## Key Expectations
- Commands and scripts should be well-tested and reliable
- Always prioritize safety (e.g., avoid destructive operations without warnings)
- Include appropriate error handling
- Make scripts portable when possible
